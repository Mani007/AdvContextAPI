Alternative to prop drilling(also rerendering of multiple component unnecessarily), React provide Context API. 
### Basic Structure of ContextAPI in the old version of React
1. createContext()
For creation of context. 
2. Provider
For providing context data to right component. 
3. Consumer
For consumption of context data at the right component.
